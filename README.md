## Deep Neural Networks for Video Applications with Alex Conway
-- TALK --
Most CCTV video cameras exist as a sort of time machine for insurance purposes. Deep neural networks make it easy to convert video into data which can then be used to trigger real-time anomaly alerts and optimize complex business processes. Deep learning can also be used in academic research to speed up labeling of video recorded from the point of view of animals wearing go-pros. This talk will present some theory of deep neural networks for video applications as well as academic research and several applied real-world industrial examples.

## Beyond Supervised Driving by Adrien Gaidon, Toyota Research Institute
-- TALK --
Crowd-sourced steering does not sound as appealing as automated driving. We need to go beyond supervised learning for automated driving, including for computer vision problems seeing great progress with strong supervision today. First, we will motivate why this is required for long-term large-scale autonomous robots. Second, we will discuss recent state-of-the-art results obtained in the ML team at Toyota Research Institute (TRI) for unsupervised domain adaptation from simulation and self-supervised depth and pose prediction from monocular imagery. Finally, I will talk about how we actually scale to large datasets using our cloud infrastructure and distributed deep learning.
